# j2lab
Jira to GitLab Migrator
## Introduction
j2lab is an open-source project designed to facilitate the seamless migration of projects from Jira to GitLab. j2lab aims to provide a one-stop solution for teams looking to transition their project management tools without losing crucial data.

## Motivation
As of February 2, 2021, Atlassian has ceased selling new server licenses and has announced that they will terminate official support for server licenses in 2024. This change has significant repercussions for organizations that rely on server-based solutions, pushing them to seek alternatives. Faced with the uncertainty brought about by Atlassian's policy change, we have identified GitLab as a robust alternative that offers similar, if not better, functionalities compared to Jira.
